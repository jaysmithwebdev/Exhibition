  description: [
    "This mini exhibition is the culmination of the artist&#39;s research and creative exploration into disability identity and how it is affected by an ableist society. This arts-based research drew on the artist’s personal experience, linking to a wider cultural and social understanding of the subject, and was undertaken as the final project in her studies for a Master’s degree in Creative Practices in Education at the University of Chester.",
    "Through her lived experience, the artist has explored the feelings and frustrations of living as a disabled person within a world that is not designed to cater to her accessibility needs and in a society that is not comfortable with difference. The pieces examine what it is like to live as a disabled person, each piece reflecting the artist’s feelings created by her situation and how it impacts on her identities.",
    "The pieces in the exhibition are unfinished, both due to life circumstance and purposefully. The artist’s capability to create is often hindered by her disability; living in an ableist society is exhausting and her conditions cause fatigue, which is exacerbated by the daily struggles she encounters attempting to function within such an environment. The artist has also made the decision to keep the pieces unfinished; each piece reflects her story of her struggles with ableism and until that story, and stories of all people with disabilities, neuro-diversity and issues around mental health, are resolved, the pieces cannot be completed.",
