      "This piece focuses on the ableist comments and remarks that are said to me regularly. Mostly, people do not mean to demean or belittle me; most are just trying to help or make conversation. However, unfortunately, as a society we are quite uncomfortable with difference, which means that people often don’t know how to approach talking to me.",
      "Some instances of ableism are simply due to ignorance. When I am denied access to a space, an activity, an event or even a toilet due to inaccessibility, the people in positions of responsibility often do not know how to respond and can be passive aggressive, deflecting the problem back and even suggesting that it is me, the disabled person, who is at fault.",
      "There are, on occasion, people who do set out to hurt me or cause offence. Disabled people are often seen as easy targets for harassment, perhaps because those being aggressive think that a disabled person will not complain or retaliate (they’ve often had a shock when confronting me). I have included some of the less offensive comments on the board, but there have been some much more hurtful things said to me, including threats of sexual violence.",
      "Each instance of ableism metaphorically cuts me; it degrades me as a human being, often leaving me feeling infantilised, objectified, embarrassed and insignificant. The cuts never heal and build up with each instance, which has a devastating effect on my mental health. There is only so many times I can bite my lip, smile politely and ignore the ableist behaviour without feeling drained, metaphorically bleeding out until I become an empty shell.",

      "This piece is symbolic of the mask that I present to the world; the mask is ordered and neat (enough, there are still mistakes) but beneath there is a tangled twist of turmoil.",
      "Sometimes only those who know me well enough to see past the mask can see the reflection of what is happening to me inside.",
      "As a child, I was taught to paint on a smile; some of this is symptomatic of the era I grew up in, some is through family circumstances which meant that there was no other option than to cope.",
      "Even when I try to live as my authentic self, I am still presenting a masked version of myself; one where I can cope within and ableist society and those around me aren’t aware of the pain I am in (both physically and mentally).",
      "Masking is a common discussion point between disabled people, the neuro-diverse and around mental health.",
      "This piece is unfinished; both due to the difficulties I have cross stitching and purposefully. All the equipment around the frames, including the stand, are used to support me in the process as I’m unable to grip the needle or the frames for a sustained period. It is purposefully unfinished as to reflect my struggle against ableism.",

    description: [
      "This knitted piece is an expression of my disability identity and how it is affects every part of me. The brightness of my many identities, represented by the multiple colours, has disability caused by ableism twisted through it, as the black is twisted and knitted into the piece.",
      "In this knitting technique, intarsia, the threads of yarn must be twisted together at the back of the piece for the knitting to stay together. You can see this twisting on the back of the piece where the corner is folded over.",
      " The balls of yarn are representative of how I would like to express myself, as a vibrant, outgoing person, always involved in society. The black ball is how I often feel, the lonely “cripple” in the corner. This has been my experience of life too many times; unable to participate in an activity or an event in the way others are, I have to sit out, alone, observing life rather than participating in it.",
      "Throughout my journey with my conditions, I have been through many identities related to disability; someone who was viewed as, and viewed themselves as, able-bodied, a person with a hidden disability, a person with a walking aid, and now, an ambulatory wheelchair user.",
      "The piece is created from yarn rescued from previously unfinished projects; this was a conscious decision to include aspects of my craft that were incomplete, linking the previous versions of my disability identity to my current self.",

    name: "Death By A Thousand Cuts",
    image: "images/DeathCuts1.jpeg",
    description: [
      "This piece highlights the incidences of ableism that I navigate on a daily basis. Each instance can feel like a metaphoric pin prick or cut, one that stays with me always and never heals. Every time I encounter the same struggle, for example a lack of a dropped curb, that pin prick or cut deepens, and the pain intesifies.",
      "This is the effect an ableist society has upon me. It creates a metaphoric bleeding out that can debilitate me and my mental health. After each incident, i have to continue as if nothing has happened; I must find the strength and resilience to carry on with my day and ignore the pain, frustration and sense of worthlessness that builds up inside me.",
      "Eventually, I reach a point where I an unable to function; the sticking plasters no longer work, the pain becomes too much, and my mental health crashes. This has led to occurences where my behaviour is seen as improper and undesirable, where I have acted out and made others uncomfortable. It has also meant I have had periods of mental health crisis.",
      "I’ve been told that i often ’bang on’ about being disbaled; this is true, but without that outlet of complaining and voicing my frustrations, my mental health sprirals out of control. My opinion is that someone musy bang the drum for disability rights; if that someone is me and people get annoyed by the constant noise then so be it. Until they understand how damaging it is to live with the metaphoric bleeding out, I will continue to ’bang on’.",

Image description of the artwork: A pin board on a table to which are pinned different brightly coloured speech bubbles. On each speech bubble is written a phrase. A small crocheted figure stands on the table in front of the board; she has a white head and a red dress. A small black veil covers her face. Her eyes are represented by crosses and her head is bowed. There is a small black representation of a walking stick attached to her. Protruding from the back of the figure are multiple red threads, each of which is attached to the speech bubbles on the pin board. End description. ",

Image Description of the Artwork: An embroidery stand sits on a table; in the stand is a framed piece of unfinished cross stitch which depicts a wheelchair symbol in white thread, surrounded by an unfinished square of blue. The words I’m fine are stitched above in red thread, with the n and the e in fine unfinished. Below the stand is a mirror which reflects the back of the of the work and the tangle of threads. A smaller frame stands at the bottom of the stand; it depicts a wheelchair symbol stitched in red with the words I’m fine stitched above it in green and blue. Another mirror reflects the tangles at the back of this work. Two blue rubber thimbles and some threads are on the base of the stand next to the smaller frame and mirror. End description.",

    "This knitted piece is an expression of my disability identity and how it is affects every part of me. The brightness of my many identities, represented by the multiple colours, has disability caused by ableism twisted through it, as the black is twisted and knitted into the piece. In this knitting technique, intarsia, the threads of yarn must be twisted together at the back of the piece for the knitting to stay together. You can see this twisting on the back of the piece where the corner is folded over. The twisting of the threads is symbolic of how disability is twisted into my identities; it always affects who I am, but also links every aspect of me. The balls of yarn are representative of how I would like to express myself, as a vibrant, outgoing person, always involved in society. The black ball is how I often feel, the lonely “cripple” in the corner. This has been my experience of life too many times; unable to participate in an activity or an event in the way others are, I have to sit out, alone, observing life rather than participating in it.

Image Description of the Artwork: A piece of knitting, still on yellow knitting needles, sits on a table. The knitting is made of stripes with various colours mixed into each stripe and black patches can be seen at different points in each stripe. The bottom left corner of the knitting is folded over to expose the back of the work where the twisted yarns can be seen. The knitting is surrounded by brightly coloured balls of yarn. A thread of black yarn extends from of the knitting and off the table, a ball of black yarn is tucked away in the corner next to the table. End description.",
